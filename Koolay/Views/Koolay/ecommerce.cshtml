                                According to the data of the Ministry of Commerce, the 60% increase in the e-commerce sector in 2020 compared to the previous year has also affected entrepreneurship. The e-commerce sector has reached a huge global scale with its advantages such as delivering products and services to customers quickly and smoothly, increasing the market potential of sellers, offering a wide range of products to consumers, promising clear product information and reasonable prices. With its advanced logistics and supply chain advantages, e-commerce has almost completely eliminated national borders. It has also brought a new breath to the entrepreneurship sector. Here are top tips for entrepreneurs who want to get involved in e-commerce:
                            </p>

                            <blockquote><p><h4><em>How to open an e-commerce site?</em></h4></p></blockquote>
                            <p>Although you can set up a custom e-commerce site from scratch, the most preferred method today is a site purchased from a ready-made e-commerce site provider. The major advantage of such ready-made websites is that they already include many marketing and accounting integrations and can be integrated relatively easily into future ERP systems. There are many examples of foreign or domestic ready-made websites.</p>
                            <p>Among overseas service providers, companies such as Shopify, Wix, Woocommerce, Magento and Bigcommerce can be given as examples, and among domestic service providers Ideasoft, Ticimax, Kobimaster and Akinon can be given as examples. Of course, service providers are not limited to this, with the deepening of the research, you may encounter different companies with many different features. One of the main priorities when choosing is to evaluate functionality and integration and, if possible, talk to reference users to make a decision.
                            </p>

                            <p><h4>What should we pay attention to?</h4></p>
                            <p>
                                The most important issue that sellers should pay attention to, especially for new sellers, is the accounting transactions. Many sellers who do not fully track the profitability of their sales believe they are making a profit, but realize they are making a loss when their equity starts to run out. In particular, sellers who sell from more than one product and channel are faced with different commission rates and maturities. When issues such as returns, other deductions, shipping costs, value added tax are added to this point, if they are not followed correctly from the beginning, they will become unsolvable after a while.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While the integration procedure is easier to follow, our advice is that anyone involved in trading should have at least an entry level accounting knowledge to keep track of their transactions. In short, it is very important for all seller candidates who will start trading or e-commerce to enter the sector by learning accounting rather than trading.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote><p><h4><em>How is a sense of security created?</em></h4></p></blockquote>
                            <p>
                                We see that the volume of e-commerce has increased in Turkey, but the number of e-commerce sites has decreased. The biggest reason for the preferred market is the trust given to the consumers. He knows that when the consumer has a problem with the product or simply wants to use his right to return, he can easily initiate the return process and get his payment back without even contacting the seller. On the other hand, the seller ensures that the products he sells are paid when due. However, it should be emphasized that the process on the seller side is not as simple as on the consumer side and regular checking of payments/deductions is a basic requirement.
                            </p>

                            <p><h4>What are the main challenges?</h4></p>
                            <p>
                                In addition to the difficulty of analyzing and tracking the profitability of sales, the biggest challenge in business operations is product sourcing. Seller candidates who are new to the industry tend to try the industry by buying and selling branded products.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Due to multiple purchases, sellers who have worked in the industry for many years and have strong funds are able to offer prices at which new sellers cannot compete in terms of purchase price and selling price. The key here is that sellers focus on creating their own brands rather than buying and selling branded products. In this way, they can get rid of the competition with the brand-registered Buybox and sell high-profit products in the long run. But of course, it is worth remembering that creating your own brand is a more difficult and costly problem than buying and selling.
